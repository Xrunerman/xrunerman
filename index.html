by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, high school students living in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1933. They sold Superman
to Detective Comics, the future DC Comics, in 1938. Superman debuted in Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938) and subsequently 
appeared in various radio serials, newspaper strips, television programs, films, and video games. With this success, Superman 
helped to create the superhero archetype and establish its primacy within the American comic book. The character is also 
referred to by such epithets as the Man of Steel, the Man of Tomorrow, and The Last Son of Krypton.</h2>

superhuman abilities, which, upon reaching maturity, he resolved to use for the benefit of humanity through a secret "Superman" identity.</h2>
